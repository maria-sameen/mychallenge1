# <mychallenge1>

## Description

This project follows accessibility standards for a digital marketing website. The code is adjusted following a semantic HTML and CSS structure so that it is easy to follow. 
I have learnt how to adapt code so that it is reachable to individuals that may not be able to physically read and interact with the website. This will optimise search engines on the site.

## usage 

This website's accessibility has been updated so it reaches more people and avoids further legal complications.
